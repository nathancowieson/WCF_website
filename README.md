# WCF_website

This repository facilitates editting a specific website and is not intended to be a reuseable tool of any sort.

## Installation
A local copy of the various HTML and resource files can be created using the expected `git clone nathancowieson/WCF_website` command.

## Useage
After creating a local clone the intention is then to make the changes locally, checking how it looks, push the changes to github and trigger a pull from the host server.

## History
The code was originally created using the depricated Mac iWeb software. Following the move to github it has been editted using either emacs or SeaMonkey.

## Credits
Thanks to Mark Craig for putting the site together and maintaining it for so long.

## License
No license.
